# Mina zkApp: Loyalties

## Pitch

Introducing a revolutionary solution for businesses and organizations looking to connect with their partners, employees, and customers using NFTs, tokens, and Dapps. With our solution, traditional companies and organizations no longer need to know their customers' wallet addresses, whilst making it impossible for bot networks to exploit giveaways and maintaining privacy. Partners and customers receive their tokens via mail and can claim their airdrop with any wallet they like, thanks to a ZK proof of a private token they received earlier via Web2 Mail, Messenger, or textâ€”the preferred method of communication for traditional businesses and organizations.

Our solution is more secure, prevents frontrunning attacks, and could be a valuable asset to companies looking to engage with their customers on-chain. A small fee can be charged for every partner program deployed using the zkDapp. Join the Web3 revolution and engage with your customers in a more secure, private, and rewarding way with our innovative solution.
